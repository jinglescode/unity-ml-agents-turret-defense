**The Unity Machine Learning Agents Toolkit** (ML-Agents) is an open-source
project that enables games and simulations to serve as environments for
training intelligent agents. Agents can be trained using reinforcement learning,
imitation learning, neuroevolution, or other machine learning methods through a
simple-to-use Python API. We also provide implementations (based on TensorFlow)
of state-of-the-art algorithms to enable game developers and hobbyists to easily
train intelligent agents for 2D, 3D and VR/AR games. These trained agents can be
used for multiple purposes, including controlling NPC behavior (in a variety of
settings such as multi-agent and adversarial), automated testing of game builds
and evaluating different game design decisions pre-release. The ML-Agents
Toolkit is mutually beneficial for both game developers and AI researchers as it
provides a central platform where advances in AI can be evaluated on Unity’s
rich environments and then made accessible to the wider research and game
developer communities.

## Features

- 15+ [example Unity environments](docs/Learning-Environment-Examples.md)
- Support for multiple environment configurations and training scenarios
- Flexible Unity SDK that can be integrated into your game or custom Unity scene
- Training using two deep reinforcement learning algorithms, Proximal Policy
  Optimization (PPO) and Soft Actor-Critic (SAC)
- Built-in support for Imitation Learning through Behavioral Cloning or
  Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning
- Self-play mechanism for training agents in adversarial scenarios
- Easily definable Curriculum Learning scenarios for complex tasks
- Train robust agents using environment randomization
- Flexible agent control with On Demand Decision Making
- Train using multiple concurrent Unity environment instances
- Utilizes the [Unity Inference Engine](docs/Unity-Inference-Engine.md) to
  provide native cross-platform support
- Unity environment [control from Python](docs/Python-API.md)
- Wrap Unity learning environments as a [gym](gym-unity/README.md)

See our [ML-Agents Overview](docs/ML-Agents-Overview.md) page for detailed
descriptions of all these features.
