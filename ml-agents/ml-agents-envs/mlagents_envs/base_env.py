"""
Python Environment API for the ML-Agents toolkit
The aim of this API is to expose Agents evolving in a simulation
to perform reinforcement learning on.
This API supports multi-agent scenarios and groups similar Agents (same
observations, actions spaces and behavior) together. These groups of Agents are
identified by their BehaviorName.
For performance reasons, the data of each group of agents is processed in a
batched manner. Agents are identified by a unique AgentId identifier that
allows tracking of Agents across simulation steps. Note that there is no
guarantee that the number or order of the Agents in the state will be
consistent across simulation steps.
A simulation steps corresponds to moving the simulation forward until at least
one agent in the simulation sends its observations to Python again. Since
Agents can request decisions at different frequencies, a simulation step does
not necessarily correspond to a fixed simulation time increment.
